Hi Welcome Everyone! ðŸ˜Š 

This is my first project that I learned to use Playwright automation tools.
Using the SauceDemo dummy website to learn Playwright, I made simple test cases such as the Login case, the case of purchasing items to payment, and API Testing in Playwright. 

ðŸ“œ Test Case

- Login Test Case
- End-to-End Case (From Login until Payment)
- API Test Case (From https://reqres.in)

ðŸš€ Tech Stack

- JavaScript
- GitHub
- Visual Studio Code

ðŸ”— How to use
